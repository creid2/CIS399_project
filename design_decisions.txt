Can anyone see the lobby / game in progress?
Should there be a password recovery mechanism? If so, how? Email would mean that we have to get emails from everyone. Letting the teacher view all the passwords isn't great either.
    I suspect the best option is to allow the teacher to reset a password


Possible teacher actions:
    Create new question set
    Alter question set
    Start a game
    Alter someone's points
    Reset someone's password
    Delete user
    Reset the points for a new game

Potential 'user' view:
    View past scores?
    Change password
    Change avatar

Need:
    

Database should consist of:
    Users
Name, Image, Password, Points, Permissions

    Questions
Question, Answer, Set


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        For Index page:
Log in:
Requires username,
         Password
On success: 
    Returns a cookie to the user, used to track session
On Failure:
    Returns user to index page

New User:
Requires username
         Password
Returns a cookie to the user, used to track session

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

            For Lobby page
Requires:
    login to view
    cookie must not be set to "game:yes" or whatever we use
    web sockets for each person
    Database requests to get:
        current leaderboard
        User permissions / points
Actions:
    Admin starts game
        Server gives another cookie (or updates existing one) to allow access to game.html

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

        Game page
Requires:
    Logged in
    Game started
    cookie must be set to "game:yes" or whatever we use

On startup:
    Server creates game cards for each user (including teacher?)

Actions:
    Bingo (button):
        Automatic verificaton.
        Only enabled when they have a bingo (but doesn't tell them they have one)
        On press, alerts all users with alert()
    Answer selection:
        Verifies against current question
        Changes color of bingo field
        If correct:
            Calls bingo verification function
            Updates correct answers for this user only
            Updates color permanently
        If wrong:
            Color goes back to normal at end of question
    Question times out:
        Updates correct answers for all users
        Question is changed
        Colors of incorrect answers are reset
    Game ends:
        Alert window for all users, when they click OK, return to lobby
        Reset the cookie value that puts in 'game'
        Update points in database
    Button to abort game:
        Only teacher can press
        calls Game End (maybe with custom alert?)
    Button to pause game:
        Only teacher can press
        Halts the countdown on the server
        Display time left as "Pause"
        Ideally hide bingo fields and question field
